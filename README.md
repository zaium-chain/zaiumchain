## 🧩 Overview

**ZAIUM Chain** is a next-generation blockchain focused on decentralization, security and sustainable long-term growth.  
Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations through transparent, scalable and eco-efficient blockchain technology.

ZAIUM is being built as a fully open-source project, designed to become a global infrastructure layer for payments, smart applications, and decentralized systems.
