🧩 Overview

ZAIUM Chain is an independent blockchain engineered for fast, secure and decentralized micropayments.
Built as a clean fork of Bitcoin, ZAIUM preserves the robustness of the Bitcoin architecture while introducing its own identity, parameters and long-term vision.

The project focuses on delivering a payment-optimized, transparent and resilient blockchain layer that remains simple, auditable and efficient.

🚀 Core Ecosystem

The ZAIUM ecosystem is composed of several planned components:

🟧 zaium-core – Full node implementation (PoW SHA-256, UTXO model).

🟦 zaium-wallet – Official non-custodial wallet (desktop & mobile).

🟪 zaium-explorer – Block explorer showcasing blocks, transactions and network metrics.

📄 zaium-whitepaper – Technical documentation, economics and system architecture.


All repositories will be open-source under the MIT license.
